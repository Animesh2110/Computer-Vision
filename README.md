Ultrasound scans are useful in scanning the internal tissues of the body which 
in turn helps to detect any kind of injury or disease in human body. But due to some factors the ultrasond images are distorted. In this project we do image    segmentation on the ultrasound nerve image for the sole purpose of portraying   the image in a more significant and worthwhile manner. Doing this we can highlight the important parts in any medical ultrasound image which can be used by doctors for various medical purposes. We perform nerve segmentation with (i) initial seed points (ii) reference mask. Then we will compare between the two different segmentation methods we used.
